2. Inside the scenes folder is a Unity scene called MainMenuVR, double click to open up the scene in Unity.

5. Use your hands navigate the VR menu, and then input the same SIGGRAPH serial number with the reviwer you want to play with.

### Handling with Errors

- When the height of the VR gaze is different from real height : You need to set the Oculus floor height again. The appropriate location should be the teleport toggle at the head height.

- Trouble with Oculus hand-tracking system : Normally restarting the VR game in Unity will solve the problem. If this doesn't work, you need to restart the Oculus Quest 2.

- If you don't see NPCs moving in VR scene : Restart the Game in both platform. Please check the internet connection and use stable Wi-Fi.

If you restart the game from one side, others have to restart the game too. Please aware of this when you play our demo. If there is an question, feel free to ask! Thank you!
