- Improved volume computation for maintaining surface position when flask is rotated (rotationLevelBias option)
- Improved sample prefabs settings

Version 4.5.1
- [Fix] Fixed build issue when floating point buffers are enabled

Version 4.5
- New option in Shader Features section to disable floating point buffers (improves compatibility with old mobile devices)

Version 4.4.3
- Improvements to irregular topology rendering

Version 4.4.2
- Check for camera inside the liquid now accounts for near clip plane
- Reduced shader compilation time
- [Fix] Fixes to Bake Rotation and Center Pivot for complex objects

Version 4.4.1
- Unity 2018.3 support
- Increased precision of irregular topology
- [Fix] Fixed irregular issue when using non-uniform scaling and scale.x is less than scale.z

Version 4.4 2018-DEC-08
- Added "Fix Mesh" option which dynamically centers the pivot of the mesh without cloning the asset
- Expanded Upper/Lower Limit ranges

Version 4.3 2018-JUN-06
